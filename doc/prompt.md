as a senior developper, writing professional code, adding proper coments in code, could you provide code for platformio, to test esp32 wifi. This code will run an access point, and will run a web server that will be provide all feature to test wifi module. The webpage should be modern, responsive, with javascript.
Include the code in main.cpp file.

as a senior developper, writing professional code, adding proper coments in code, coudl you add feature to validate the esp32 wifi is working as expected, providing tools to test round trip, test debit, test power, report any packet are lost, and any information that would make sense to prove the wifi module of esp32 is working properly.

the web page shows only test latency and test throughput, but nothing about lost packets. Is there other usefull data that could be required to validate the esp32 is working perfectly ?
